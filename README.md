# About Me

## My interests
    Some of my interests include things like playing video games, listening to music and watching movies. I enjoy many games some of my favorites being Elden Ring_, _League of Legends_, and _Sea of Thieves_. My favorite
    genre of music is Rap music and my favorite artist is Juice WRLD. My all time favorite movie is _Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse_ as I love the animation style and characters. I enjoy computer programming and hope 
    to make that my career.

## Websites I recommend
    [ChatGPT] (https://chatgpt.com/) - I think ChatGPT is a very useful tool for finding information very quickly. Although not as credible as many other sources, it does provide and easier insight into many topics. I 
    user it quite frequently to help explain topics I don't understand very well since it's good at simplifying information.
    [Reddit] (https://www.reddit.com/) - I find Reddit to be a very good place to discuss interests and topics with other users. There are a vast majority of subreddit communities to visit and find lots of information
    about. I visit many subreddits quite often to help with any personal projects, games I play or even just to expand my interests.
